				At <strong>Arson Incorporated</strong> we offer one service, and we do it very well. We help disabled people deal
				with an abled society. By setting things on fire. Need to go to your first cousin once reomved's wedding dinner, 
				but you don't have enough spoons and you are worried about being rude if you refuse? Using our pattented method, 
				we will, for a nominal fee, simply light the venue on fire, getting you out of a painful evening of socializing. 
				Unable to eat because all the food in your house has a bad texture? Making us of an internal combustion engine we will procure your 
				safe food. Your boss refusing to give you your accomdations despite the ADA? We will light your boss on fire. By 
				supporting us you are also supporting a locally owned buisness ran by a disabled person. <br>
				Want get into the hobby yourself? We also provide an arson kit, complete with:
