				At <strong>Genric Incorporated</strong> we offer a product, and that product is very good. No one is entirely sure
				what that product is, but we assure you it is of the highest quality. And who wouldn't want this vague, generic 
				product? After all,if you don't have it you don't know what you're missing! It could very easily change your life!
				You won't ever have enough of this product! It is made with only the very finest generic materials! After all, 
				Look at all this HTML! It's very fine HTML. Surely this excellent HTML would only be on a website for the best of 
				products! Observe how the gradient in the background transitions between five colors, and not only two? And how all 
				of the links send you too a diffrent page, as a link should do! And look at the styles! Those couldn't possibly 
				be programed in with HTML alone! It must also use Cascading Style Sheets! You must really want to buy our vague, 
				generic product now, yes?<br>
				And now, a vague list of generic products:
